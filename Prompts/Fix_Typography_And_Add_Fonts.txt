PROJECT CONTEXT:
Framework: Lightning Web Runtime (LWR)
Component System: Lightning Web Components (LWC)
CSS Architecture: Custom CSS variables, scoped styles.
Backend: Node.js

REQUEST FORMAT:

[OBJECTIVE]
1. Fix the Typography issue where selected fonts are not being applied to the canvas or preview.
2. Add more fonts from Google Fonts.
3. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use CDNs. Download the font files (WOFF/WOFF2) and install them locally in the project.

[AFFECTED AREAS]
- src/modules/custom/sidePanel/sidePanel.js (Font selection logic)
- src/modules/custom/sidePanel/sidePanel.html (Dropdown options)
- Assets/Fonts directory (New directory needed for font files)
- Global CSS or builder CSS (To define @font-face rules)

[CURRENT BEHAVIOR]
- Selecting a font in the "Typography" section of the side panel updates the internal state variables, but the visual appearance of the text on the Canvas and Preview does not change.
- The project likely lacks the `@font-face` definitions or the actual font files to render non-system fonts.

[DESIRED BEHAVIOR]
1. **Local Font Support**:
   - Download a set of popular Google Fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins, Inter).
   - Place them in a static assets folder (e.g., `src/assets/fonts` or `public/assets/fonts`).
   - Create a CSS file (e.g., `fonts.css`) with standard `@font-face` definitions for these fonts.
2. **Apply Fonts**:
   - Ensure that when a user selects a font, the correct CSS variable (e.g., `--s-font-family-body`, `--s-font-family-heading`) is updated and effectively changes the font on the Canvas.
3. **Expanded Selection**:
   - Update the `fontOptions` list in `sidePanel.js` to include the newly added local fonts.

[SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]
- self-hosted fonts only.
- Must support WOFF2 format for best performance.

[ATTACHMENTS/REFERENCES]
- See attached screenshot of the Typography section in Side Panel.
