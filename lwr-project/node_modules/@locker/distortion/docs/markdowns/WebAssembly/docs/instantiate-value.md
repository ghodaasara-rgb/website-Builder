## WebAssembly.instantiate

The [`WebAssembly.instantiate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebAssembly/instantiate) function allows you to compile and instantiate WebAssembly code. It takes a WebAssembly binary code and an optional import object that provides values to be imported into the new instance.

The import object can contain functions, memory, tables, and globals that the WebAssembly module can use. However, for security reasons, Lightning Web Security prevents the `eval` function from being passed through the imports argument.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion throws an exception when a reference to `eval` is detected at any depth in the import object structure.
