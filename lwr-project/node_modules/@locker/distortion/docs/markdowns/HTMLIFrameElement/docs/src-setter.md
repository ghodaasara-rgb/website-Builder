## HTMLIFrameElement.prototype.src setter

The [`HTMLIFrameElement.prototype.src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/src) property reflects the HTML `referrerpolicy` attribute of the `<iframe>` element defining which referrer is sent when fetching the resource. The `src` value is a string that reflects the `src` HTML attribute, containing the address of the content to be embedded.

Lightning Web Security restricts the `src` attribute to values that use the `http://`, `https://`, and `about:blank` schemes, or relative urls. URL schemes like `javascript://` aren't allowed.

Lightning Web Security disallows access to URL endpoints containing `"/aura"` and `"/webruntime"` because they are part of the Lightning Component framework.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion throws an exception for values that don't sanitize to `http://`, `https://`, and `about:blank` schemes, or relative urls. If set to a same-origin url, the iframe will be sandboxed. This distortion also examines the `hostname` and the `pathname` of the URL. If there's a match to a disallowed endpoint, it throws an exception.
